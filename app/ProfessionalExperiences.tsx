    description: `Development of Serendy, a dating application focused on the present moment.
    What sets Serendy apart is its natural, spontaneous approach, breaking with the endless exchange of messages often devoid of real encounters. User A sends a request to user B, and if accepted, a rendezvous point emerges with three bar proposals to make the meeting a reality. Serendy thus optimizes the dating process by placing the real world at the heart of the experience.`,
